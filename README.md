# basic-calculator

This calculator is a wip right now but the end result is to create a scientific calculator with a graphical interface that hopefully can be customized by the user

will most likely be made in python but possibly also in C or Java for variety

hopefully can finish it eventually

I had some python code on my laptop that I will upload once I find the file
